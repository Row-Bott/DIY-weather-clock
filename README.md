# DIY-weather-clock
esp01s DIY weather clock that ca be purchased for low cost but has Chinese firmware on it that forces you to sign up to their sites. I have written this code to have no sign up whatsoever. 

At the time of writing (30 Dec '25), it requires a slight tweak for resetting the Wi-Fi.

I have written some major UK cities and local ones for my kids.
